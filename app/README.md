## Report

This project was way harder than the previous one, I found it very challenging,
I tried to do the way you showed us in the class but that didn't led me anywhere,
I got stuck o the login page, I was kinda able to do something else but i was only getting errors,
so I decided to do in a different way, I ended up doing a new project using a real database, Firebase,
which I will have to say that was not an easy task as well but I felt more confident doing it,
because there is a lot of tutorials and documentation about it, whereas using postman and a fake database I couldn't find much,
even my classmates were struggling with it, so I focused on the Firebase project and I was able to do most of the requirements.
I know that I was going to finish every single requirement but I had an issue with the cart,
it was working fine but at some point when I had to add "observe" to the CartFragment, line 37, it started to give me an error,
it was saying that the "observe" was not a function, I tried to fix it but I couldn't, I tried to do it in a different way but it didn't work,
so as I didn't have much time left I decided to leave it like that, so I just "fixed" to don't give any main errors.
As I knew the cart was not going to work I focused on the other requirements.
once I was done with the requirements, I did what I like to do best which is the UI, I tried to make it as good as I could, within the time I had,
I designed the logo and made up a name for the store "Nerd Action", which is an action figure store,
I got all of the images from a real store, Iron Studios, that i already had bought from, I also got the description of the products from there,
I know that I could have done a better job but I knew I didn't have much time left.
I hope you understand and I hope you like it.
